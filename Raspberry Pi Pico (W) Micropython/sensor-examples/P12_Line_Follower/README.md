# Line Follower
The code prints "Following the line..." with onboard LED ON if it detects the line in the range and sensitivity of adjusted and prints "Out of the line..." with onboard LED OFF if it goes out of the path. We can adjust the sensor range and sensitivity by turning the potentiometer to the side. Some of the sensors also have small LED as indicator.
